Since 2009, the Med-CORDEX initiative ([www.medcordex.eu](https://www.medcordex.eu)) proposed a unique framework where the research community makes use of high-resolution regional atmospheric, land surface, river and oceanic climate models as well as fully-coupled Regional Climate System Models (RCSM) for increasing the reliability of past and future regional climate information and understanding the processes that are responsible for the Mediterranean climate variability and trends.

The 6th Med-CORDEX workshop was held from November 25 to 29, 2019 in Toulouse (France).

More information about Med-CORDEX can be found [here](https://www.medcordex.eu/).

The 6th Med-CORDEX workshop aimed to review the activities of the second phase of Med-CORDEX, including the so-called baseline runs performed with coupled RCSMs and the 3 CORDEX Flagship Pilot Studies (FPS) proposed by Med-CORDEX (FPS-convection, FPS-aerosol, FPS-airsea). Emphasis was put on:

- multi-model analysis for past and future climate evolutions
- very-high resolution, convection-permitting climate modelling
- component interactions (atmosphere, land, ocean, aerosol, biogeochemistry, ...) in the Mediterranean regional climate system
- new ideas and approaches in regional climate modelling
- use of regional climate models to solve key scientific questions for the Mediterranean region
- user-oriented approaches, data and metadata availability
- Med-CORDEX achievements so far and open challenges for the coming years

The workshop consisted of a series of short talks to review the model and run status, scientific talks in targeted sessions, working group discussions, coordination actions, side events of Med-CORDEX related projects as well as breaks for free interactions.

Researchers interested in Med-CORDEX or CORDEX-FPS modelling activities or in regional climate multi-model analyses and Med-CORDEX data users are welcome.
