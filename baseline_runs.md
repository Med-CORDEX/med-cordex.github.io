# Med-CORDEX phase 2: the baseline runs

Since its launch, one of the main strength and originality of the Med-CORDEX initiative within CORDEX is the setting, coordination and use of coupled RCMs also called Regional Climate System Models (RCSM) 
including at least the representation of the atmosphere, land-surface and ocean components (see Ruti et al. 2016 for more details and illustrations of the first results or [read this](simulations.md)). 
This led the Med-CORDEX community to propose RCSM simulations to become the baseline runs for the second phase of Med-CORDEX.

The main challenges addressed by the baseline runs are:

   - Characterization of the past regional climate variability and trends
   - Characterization (incl. uncertainty) of the future regional climate evolution
   - Characterization of the past variability and future evolution of relevant Mediterranean climate phenomena
   - Contribution to the characterization of the Mediterranean climate change impacts
